 The judge class is responsible for evaluating some combination of data and producing a score for it.  The Judge is allowed to consider data as relative or absolute.  There are no data accessors around judging, only the requirement that by the end you produce some integer value.  If possible, you can provide a maximum and minimum value to give context to the score.
