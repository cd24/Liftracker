import SwiftyBeaver

// Defines the log level for the application.  This reduces the cost at compile time by transforming logging calls from buffer outputs to empty methods.  This prevents the need for a runtime check on logging - minisucle, but non-zero savings :)

/**
    Right now, this class acts as a wrapper on SwiftBeaver.  It forwards messages and setups accordingly. 
    However, this class provides an abstraction to logging which will allow us to hotswap any logging utility
 
    Control logging using the compiler flags.  You MUST include each flag you want to consider.  This simplifies the logic in this class.  This means that you can control exactly what logs you want output, rather than having a level.  
 
    - Active Compilation Conditions:
        - VEBOSE:  Verbose logging
        - DEBUG:   Debug logging
        - INFO:    Info logging
        - ERROR:   Error logging
        - WARNING: Warning logging
