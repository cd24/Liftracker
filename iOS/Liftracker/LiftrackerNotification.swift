/**
 This protocol describes a type of notification which can be sent from the Liftracker app.  Any implementation of this protocol will be added to the notification utility when the utility is created in application(:didFinishLaunching:withOptions).
 
 In short, objects of this type will be instantiated when a remote notification of a matching identifier is recieved using init(incoming:).  The object will have handle() invoked on it to perform and processing of the notification.  All instances are shown as alerts.  The object will be deallocated when the notification loop completed.
 
 All methods are invoked on the main thread.
