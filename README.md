# Liftracker iOS

The Liftracker iOS project is designed to provide low-cost data collection and easy abstractions for developers to create tools to improve working out.  This project aims to be an open way to share data processors for consumer use.

Due to the sensitive nature of the data, any extensions added must be approved by the maintainer via pull request.  This is to enforce the strict no-upload policy of the environment.
