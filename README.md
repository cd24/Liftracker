# Liftracker

Liftracker is a simple app for collecting and analyzing your weight training data.  The first release offered powerful free-form workout support.  The 2.0 release looks to improve upon the app by allowing users to use both free-form and structured workouts.  In addition, we are looking to change the way that we store data to improve performance and reliability.  In this redesign, we hope to improve the models to allow you to better control and utilize your data.  As always, everything is handled on-device and never touches our systems (granted, we don't have any servers...).  We hope you enjoy this release of the App.

## Contributing

Liftracker is an open source project, and I would love to have the community's help in designing and implementing the app.  If there is a feature you think would make a great addition to Liftracker, please fork and edit to your hearts content!

Everything is handled through fastlane and cocoapods, so you should be able to get up and running using [pods](https://cocoapods.org):

``` shell
pod install
```
